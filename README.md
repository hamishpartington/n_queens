# The N-Queens Puzzle

This was the first piece of coursework for my C module on my Computer Science Msc.

In the first instance we were asked to implement a pre-specified brute force algorithm to solve the N-Queens puzzle, which took the size of the board as an argument.

For an extension, I implemented an alternative recursive solution and displayed solutions to the puzzle using SDL.

I recieved a Merit for this coursework with a mark of 63.
